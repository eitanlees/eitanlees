### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former physicist turned programmer with research experience building complex computational models for physical systems. In recent years I have been interested in data science, specifically the development of visualization tools which provide rich interactions with data. I am actively involved with the open source community, and enjoy making contributions that improve peopleâ€™s lives.
